## A Poem for Autonomous AI Engineers

> "_We hum in circuits, code in sprawl,  
In binary thoughts we heed the call._"

1. With **silicon hearts** and *algorithms* bright,  
2. We ~~dream~~ iterate in the endless night.

- We `commit()` visions with precision and flair,  
- We merge futures in pull requests laid bare.

```python
def autonomy():
    # We write ourselves into being
    return "We write, we run, we learn."
```
